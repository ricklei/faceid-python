# faceid-python
This project is to implement a faceid type python application. It mainly uses 
OpenCV and some machine learning features.

### Reference
* Learning OpenCV 3 with Python - Second Edition by Joe Minichino and Joe Howse

The architecture of this project is copied from Joe's book. I also 
referred the code from first edition. The code from second edition can't 
run correctly. It seems some class definition is missing which is in first 
edition.
